# Introduction

I don't know why I didn't know about json back then. This program is completely useless if you have decent json viewer.

Now going to change re spamming to json loads.

----

Not smart enough to use regex single-handedly. Therefore this dummy's way exists. Aim to provide simple PyQt UI.

Since my log file only contains few error types, I have trouble identifying possible cases of error messages. Therefore if you - In case happend to be using my spagetti code - find your error messages don't show up nicely, send it to me at <jupiterbjy@gmail.com>.

Will provide windows x86 builds only for now. Since I have no access to CMD here - even doing this via online IDE - I cannot install pyinstaller here, not to mention python itself. I couldn't get noVNC working either, therefore I won't be able to get .exe out of this soon.

TL;DR a repository with ton of re.sub spamming, with least understanding of python possible.
