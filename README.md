# Introduction

Not smart enough to use regex single-handedly. Therefore this dummy's way exists. Aim to provide simple PyQt UI.

Since I don't have enough test-cases, I have no idea how to format stuff to match all possible cases. Current goal is making sure all my own log file shows up neat and clean.

Will provide linux builds only, for now. Since I have no access to CMD here - even using online IDE - I cannot install pyinstaller here, not to mention python itself. I couldn't get noVNC working either, I won't be able to get .exe out of this soon.
